	Before I signed up for the .NET bootcamp, I worked as a substitute teacher.  My chosen subjects were science and language arts, with the content that I taught primarily geared for Ohio students in middle school (grades 4-9).  Most recently, I worked with a group called "Classroom Antics," that used programs such as "Game Maker," "Scratch," and "Minecraft" to teach the logic of programming.

	While I did enjoy most of the places I taught at, I did not get to do nearly as much teaching as I would have liked.  Competition for permanent positions was and is fierce, and having not obtained a classroom of my own, I had to deeply consider how badly I wanted to remain in my chosen field.  Given my fondness for programming, and the high job placement professed by the boot camp, it struck me as a logical choice to sign up.

	I am both excited and mildly anxious to be a professional software developer.  It is somewhat familiar ground, in that I have dabbled in VBA programming while teaching, some mods for Bethesda games, and the aforementioned experience teaching with "Classroom Antics."  On the other hand, I did not expect to take this path, and it is a departure from how I expected my career to go,  hence the mixed feelings on this enterprise.
